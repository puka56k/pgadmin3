# AGENTS.md — macOS port notes

Working notes for porting pgAdmin3 (this fork) to build/run natively on macOS
(Apple Silicon, Cocoa backend via wxWidgets). Intended for whichever agent
picks up this work next — treat this as a running log, not final docs.

## Branching strategy (IMPORTANT — read before editing)

- `main` is the primary work branch. `master` tracks
  `origin/master` (`git@github.com:levinsv/pgadmin3.git`), which is itself a
  Russian-language fork of the official `postgres/pgadmin3`. The user pulls
  updates from `origin` regularly and wants **zero/near-zero merge conflicts**.
- All work (including macOS porting) happens on `main`. Never commit directly
  to `master` — that branch is only for pulling upstream changes.
- To pick up upstream changes: `git checkout master && git pull origin
  master`, then `git checkout main && git rebase master` (or merge, if rebase
  gets messy).
- When editing shared source files, prefer **additive, ifdef-guarded**
  changes that slot into the existing platform-conditional style already used
  in this codebase (`#ifdef __WXMSW__` / `#ifdef __WXGTK__` / `#ifndef
  __WXMSW__`). Add a new `#ifdef __WXMAC__` / `#ifdef __APPLE__` arm next to
  the existing ones rather than restructuring the conditional. This mirrors
  the existing pattern and keeps diffs small and mergeable.
- Prefer new files (e.g. a macOS CMake overlay) over editing
  `CMakeLists.txt` in place, where possible. If `CMakeLists.txt` must change,
  keep edits additive (new `elseif(APPLE)` branch) rather than touching the
  existing Windows/Linux logic.
- Do not touch `.vcxproj*` files (Windows/Visual Studio only, irrelevant to
  macOS, editing them risks unrelated conflicts).

## Project shape (as of 2026-07-13)

- wxWidgets 3.2+ C++ GUI app (PostgreSQL admin tool), CMake-based build.
- `CMakeLists.txt` already builds cleanly cross-platform via `find_package`
  for wxWidgets/PostgreSQL/libxml2/libxslt — no macOS-specific block exists
  yet (`else()` branch after `if(NOT CROSS_COMPILE)` is generic, currently
  exercised only by Linux CI).
- Zero hits for `__WXMAC__` / `__WXOSX__` / `__APPLE__` anywhere in the
  codebase before this port — this has **never been built on macOS**.
- ~48 files reference `__WXMSW__`, ~48 reference `__WXGTK__` (heavy overlap:
  mostly in `pgAdmin3.cpp`). Many Windows branches have a companion
  `#ifndef __WXMSW__` fallback, which today runs under Linux/GTK and should
  be a reasonable starting point for macOS too (may still need mac-specific
  tweaks for menu bar / keyboard shortcuts / native dialogs — Cocoa quirks
  won't surface until runtime).
- CI (`.github/workflows/*.yml`) only builds on `ubuntu-22.04`, installing
  wxWidgets 3.2 from the codelite PPA equivalent, libxslt/libxml2 via apt,
  postgresql server dev via apt.
- Homebrew has wxwidgets (currently 3.3.3, satisfies the `3.2` minimum),
  libxml2, libxslt, postgresql@16/@17, catch2 — all keg-only or need
  explicit `-D` hints for CMake `find_package` since Homebrew doesn't put
  keg-only libs on default search paths.

## Status log

- 2026-07-13: Branch created, exploring feasibility. No mac-specific code
  written yet. See task list / conversation for live progress; this section
  will be updated as the build gets further.
- 2026-07-13: Correction — there IS a little pre-existing mac scaffolding:
  `include/frm/frmLog.h` has an `#ifdef __WXMAC__` AUI-perspective string, and
  `include/pgAdmin3.h` has an `#ifdef __WXMAC__ void MacOpenFile(...)`. Both
  predate this session; someone attempted a mac port before but it was never
  finished/tested (no CMake path, no other mac ifdefs anywhere).
- 2026-07-13: `cmake` configure works out of the box against Homebrew
  wxwidgets/postgresql@16/libxml2/libxslt with no CMakeLists.txt changes
  needed beyond disabling `add_subdirectory(tests)` on `APPLE` (Homebrew only
  ships Catch2 v3, tests/ use the v2 single-header API — separate, unsolved
  follow-up, tracked as a TODO below).
- 2026-07-13: **Important finding** — Homebrew's `wxwidgets` bottle (3.3.3)
  is built with `wxUSE_STD_CONTAINERS=1` (wx 3.3's new default), which
  changes the shape of `WX_DECLARE_LIST`-generated classes: no more nested
  `::Node` typedef, `GetFirst()`/`GetNext()` etc. return `compatibility_iterator`
  instead of raw `Node*`, and generic `wxList`/`wxNode` (`wxObjectListNode`)
  becomes an incomplete type at the old call sites. This breaks ~262 call
  sites across 18 files (`ogl/*`, `debugger/*`, `frm/mathplot.cpp`,
  `frm/events.cpp`, `ctl/explainCanvas.cpp`, `ctl/explainShape.cpp`, etc.) —
  all legacy code written against the classic (non-std-container) wxList API
  that Windows/Linux builds use today.
  - Patching all 262 sites was rejected: too invasive, spans 18 files shared
    with Windows/Linux, high conflict risk with upstream, for what is really
    a *build configuration* mismatch, not a real portability bug (compare
    to the two genuine bugs below, which WERE worth fixing everywhere).
  - Decision: build wxWidgets 3.3.3 from source locally with
    `--disable-std_containers --with-osx_cocoa`, instead of using the
    Homebrew bottle, to match the classic-mode behavior Windows/Linux already
    rely on. Keeps the pgAdmin3 source tree untouched for this issue.
  - Fixed two small `ctlMenuToolList`/similar cases before discovering the
    scope of the problem — see commits on `macos-port` branch. Those two
    fixes (`ctl/ctlMenuToolbar.cpp`) use `compatibility_iterator`, which is
    portable across BOTH std-container and classic wx builds, so they're
    correct/harmless to keep regardless of which wx we end up using.
- Two genuine, platform-independent bugs found and fixed while getting this
  far (both real bugs that would misbehave/fail to compile on any compiler
  enforcing standard C++, not mac-specific — safe/beneficial upstream too):
  1. `include/ctl/SourceViewDialog.h` (compare-objects HTML report,
     `075347b1` by lsv): mixed `std::wstring + const char*` (narrow literal)
     in an HTML-building expression — fixed by widening the literals to
     `L"..."`.
  2. `include/frm/frmLog.h` / `frm/frmLog.cpp`: `MywxAuiDefaultTabArt`
     (custom AUI tab art) breaks under wx 3.3 because
     `wxAuiDefaultTabArt` became a `#define` alias for the new, non-copyable
     `wxAuiFlatTabArt`, and `GetTabSize()`'s DC parameter type changed from
     `wxDC&` to `wxReadOnlyDC&`. Fixed with a `wxCHECK_VERSION(3,3,0)`-gated
     typedef/Clone(), so wx 3.2 (Windows/Linux) behavior is untouched.

- 2026-07-13: More wx-3.3-vs-3.2 API breakage fixed while grinding through the
  build, all real/portable fixes (not mac-only):
  1. `frm/frmStatus.cpp`: many `wxTimerEvent evt;` (default-constructed, used
     only to synchronously call an `OnRefreshXTimer(evt)` handler as a
     "refresh now" trick — none of these handlers call `evt.GetTimer()`).
     wx 3.3 removed `wxTimerEvent`'s default ctor. Fixed by passing the
     contextually relevant `wxTimer&` (e.g. `wxTimerEvent evt(*statusTimer);`)
     at each of the ~13 call sites.
  2. `gqb/gqbGridProjTable.cpp` / `gqb/gqbGridOrderTable.cpp`: sent a
     `wxGRIDTABLE_REQUEST_VIEW_GET_VALUES` grid table message, which wx's own
     header comment says "never did anything, simply don't use them" — wx 3.3
     removed the enum value entirely unless `WXWIN_COMPATIBILITY_3_0` is on.
     Deleted the dead `wxGridTableMessage`/`ProcessTableMessage` call (true
     no-op on every wx version, confirmed no other file relies on it).
  3. `dlg/dlgVariable.cpp`: `wxScopedPtr<wxXmlDocument>` — wx's own header
     says "everything in this file is deprecated, use std::unique_ptr<>
     instead"; swapped it for `std::unique_ptr` (`#include <memory>` added).
  4. `ctl/explainCanvas.cpp` `OnMouseWhell`: called
     `wxScrollHelperBase::HandleOnMouseWheel()` directly, which is a private
     implementation detail in wx 3.3 (was reachable before). Replaced the
     whole body with `ev.Skip()`, which is the documented, portable way to
     let wx's own pushed `wxScrollHelperEvtHandler` apply default wheel
     scrolling (verified in wx's own `src/generic/scrlwing.cpp`).
  5. `ctl/ctlMenuToolbar.cpp` `DoProcessLeftClick`: same `::Node` →
     `compatibility_iterator` swap as before, plus `node == NULL` (ambiguous
     under wx 3.3 since `NULL` isn't a real `nullptr_t` here) → `!node`.
  6. `include/frm/frmLog.h` / `frm/frmLog.cpp` `MywxAuiDefaultTabArt::DrawTab`:
     wx 3.3's `wxAuiFlatTabArt` hides `m_baseColour`/`m_activeColour`/
     `m_borderPen`/`m_baseColourPen` behind a private pimpl (no getters).
     Fixed by overriding `SetColour()`/`SetActiveColour()` in
     `MywxAuiDefaultTabArt` (wx-3.3-gated) to cache the values into our own
     members, then shadowing the old member names with local `const&`
     variables at the top of `DrawTab()` — the ~150-line drawing routine
     below is completely unchanged text-wise.
  7. **A real bug in wxWidgets 3.3.3 itself** (not pgAdmin3, not mac-specific,
     reproducible on any platform): `wx/dynarray.h`'s `wxBaseArray<T>::
     operator[]`/`Item()`/`Last()` return `T&`, but the array is backed by
     `wxVector<T>` (== `std::vector<T>`), and `std::vector<bool>::operator[]`
     returns a proxy object, not `bool&` — so `wxArrayBool` (used by
     `hotdraw/figures/hdIFigure.cpp`'s `selected` member) fails to compile
     with "non-const lvalue reference ... cannot bind to a temporary of type
     reference (aka `__bit_reference<...>`)". Patched the **locally-built
     wx, not pgAdmin3** (`/Users/zv/wx-cocoa-classic/include/wx-3.3/wx/
     dynarray.h`, backup kept as `dynarray.h.orig`) to use the class's own
     `reference`/`const_reference` typedefs instead of raw `T&`/`const T&`.
     Zero impact on the pgAdmin3 repo/upstream merges since it's outside the
     git tree — but **whoever rebuilds wxWidgets from source for this port
     needs to reapply this patch** (or check if a newer wx 3.3.x point
     release has fixed it upstream first).

- 2026-07-13: **It compiles and links.** `cmake --build .` in `build-macos/`
  produces a native `arm64` Mach-O executable (`build-macos/pgAdmin3`, ~13MB).
  Also had to gate the `objcopy --only-keep-debug` POST_BUILD step (GNU
  binutils, ELF-only) behind `if(NOT APPLE)` in `CMakeLists.txt` — macOS has
  no `objcopy`; a `dsymutil`/`strip`-based equivalent could be added later
  but isn't required to get a working binary.
- 2026-07-13: First run attempt: `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Users/zv/wx-cocoa-classic/lib
  ./pgAdmin3` — the process launches, becomes the active app, and gets a
  real, localized (Czech, from system locale) native menu bar (Soubor,
  Upravit, Plugins, View, Tools, Okno, Nápověda) — confirms the Cocoa/wx
  integration itself works. BUT no window ever appears (confirmed via
  `Quartz.CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo` — zero windows owned by the process).
  Logged error: `nelze otevřít soubor '/pgadmin3.lng'` (can't open
  `/pgadmin3.lng`) — `i18nPath`/`dataDir` (`pgAdmin3.cpp` ~line 1604,
  `stdPaths.GetDataDir()`) is resolving to `/` instead of a real resource
  directory, because this is a bare unbundled executable with no
  `DATA_DIR`/resource layout set up for macOS (the Windows/Linux versions
  expect to be dropped into an existing pgAdmin3 install directory — see
  README). This specific error looks non-fatal (code just skips loading the
  language list if the read fails), so the real blocker for window creation
  is probably a different resource lookup later in `OnInit()` — not yet
  isolated. **Not investigated further this session** — getting a real
  window on screen (and/or proper `.app` bundling with Info.plist/icons/
  resource dirs) is the natural next step, scoped separately from "does it
  compile".

- 2026-07-13: User ran the binary themselves, got a real "pgAdmin III" main
  window (Object Browser, Vlastnosti/Statistics/Dependencies tabs, SQL pane —
  all rendering correctly), but it **crashed** when opening Soubor → Options
  (Ctrl-O). Crash report at
  `~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/pgAdmin3-2026-07-13-143452.ips`:
  `EXC_BAD_ACCESS`/`SIGSEGV` in `wxBitmap::ConvertToImage()`, called via
  `wxBitmapHelpers::Rescale → wxBitmapBundleImplSet::GetBitmap →
  wxGenericTreeCtrl::OnImagesChanged`, from
  `ctlTreeJSON::RefreshImageList() → InitMy() → frmOptions::frmOptions()`.
  First (wrong) theory: `GetBoundingRect()`-derived swatch bitmap size going
  `<= 0` before the tree is laid out. Added a defensive size clamp (kept —
  harmless) but the user reproduced the **exact same crash again** on the
  rebuilt binary, disproving that theory.
  - Since GUI automation couldn't reliably reach the app in this sandboxed
    session (synthetic clicks/keystrokes kept losing focus to the host
    "Claude" desktop app — confirmed via `NSWorkspace.frontmostApplication`),
    switched to a direct repro: added a temporary `PGADMIN3_TEST_OPTIONS=1`
    env-var hook in `pgAdmin3.cpp` right after `winMain->Show()` that
    constructs `frmOptions` directly, bypassing the menu entirely. This
    reproduced the crash reliably and without any GUI-focus guessing.
  - **Real root cause**: `ctlTreeJSON::RefreshImageList()` did
    `wxMask* mask = new wxMask(); bmp.SetMask(mask);` — a *default-constructed*
    `wxMask` has no actual backing bitmap. This makes `wxBitmap::GetMask()`
    return non-null (so wx's `ConvertToImage()` takes the "has a mask" code
    path), but `GetMask()->GetRawAccess()` is null, so the per-pixel masking
    loop dereferences a null pointer. Confirmed by reading
    `src/osx/core/bitmap.cpp`'s `wxBitmap::ConvertToImage()` in our locally
    built wx 3.3.3 source. These swatches are just opaque solid-colour
    rectangles with no real transparency, so the mask was pure dead weight —
    **fixed by deleting the `wxMask`/`SetMask()` calls entirely**.
  - Verified fix: rebuilt, re-ran with the `PGADMIN3_TEST_OPTIONS=1` hook —
    "Nastavení" (Options) dialog opened and rendered completely (Browser/
    Query tool/Miscellaneous tree, all the "Display the following database
    objects" checkboxes, OK/Storno buttons), no crash, no new `.ips` report.
    Removed the temporary test hook afterwards (`pgAdmin3.cpp` is back to
    its pre-hook state) and re-verified a normal launch still shows the main
    window fine.
  - The user should still do one real click-through of Soubor → Options
    themselves to be fully sure, but this is now a well-understood, directly
    reproduced-and-fixed bug rather than a guess.
- 2026-07-13: User confirmed Options no longer crashes, but got a different
  error on quit: `Chyba: nelze otevřít soubor
  '/Users/zv/Library/Preferences/postgresql/pgadmin3opt.json'`. Root cause:
  `pgAdmin3::InitAppPaths()` (`pgAdmin3.cpp` ~line 1088) sets
  `dataDir = GetUserConfigDir() + "/postgresql"` on the non-`__LINUX__`
  branch but — unlike the Linux branch right above it, which does
  `wxMkDir()` if the dir is missing — never creates that directory. Works
  in practice on Windows because it usually already exists from a previous
  install; on a first macOS run `~/Library/Preferences/postgresql/` doesn't
  exist, so both reading and writing `pgadmin3opt.json` (and presumably
  other files under `dataDir`) fail. Fixed by adding the same
  `if (!wxDir::Exists(dataDir)) wxMkDir(...)` guard to the `#else` branch.
  Verified: deleted the directory, relaunched, confirmed it gets created,
  used the app, quit, confirmed `pgadmin3opt.json` (90 bytes) was written
  with no error and no crash report.

- 2026-07-13: Added a top-level `Makefile` (OS-detected via `uname -s`) plus
  `macos/build_app.sh` + `macos/Info.plist.in`, so pgAdmin3 can be launched
  by double-clicking an icon like a normal Mac app, not just run from a
  terminal:
  - `make` (no args) — prints help/usage, including the resolved
    `WX_COCOA_PREFIX`/`LIBXML2_PREFIX`/etc for the current OS.
  - `make build` — configures+builds (macOS: also runs
    `macos/build_app.sh` to assemble a real `build-macos/pgAdmin III.app`);
    Linux path is just the plain cmake flow from INSTALL.txt/INSTALL_EN.txt
    into `build/`; anything else prints a "not wired up" message pointing at
    the existing docs/vcxproj instead of failing silently.
  - `make run` — quick dev run of the bare binary (macOS: delegates to
    `run-macos.sh`, which now reads `WX_COCOA_PREFIX` instead of a
    hardcoded `/Users/zv/...` path so it isn't tied to this one machine).
  - `make clean` — removes the OS-appropriate build dir.
  - `macos/build_app.sh` does the actual bundling: copies the wx/postgres/
    libxml2/etc dylibs the binary depends on into `Contents/Frameworks`,
    rewrites every load command to `@executable_path/../Frameworks/...` (so
    no `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` is needed at runtime), generates `AppIcon.icns`
    from the existing `include/images/pgAdmin3.ico` (via `sips`+`iconutil`),
    fills in `macos/Info.plist.in`, and ad-hoc code-signs the bundle
    (`codesign -s -`, required for unsigned binaries to launch on Apple
    Silicon — plain `cp`/`install_name_tool` invalidates the linker's
    original signature).
  - Two real bugs surfaced and got fixed while making the bundle actually
    launch via Finder/`open` (not just from a terminal with
    `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` set, which masks these):
    1. **sips can't upscale an `.ico` past its largest embedded
       resolution** (needed 512/1024px icon slots from a 256px source) —
       fixed by converting the `.ico` to a plain PNG first (`sips -s format
       png`) and resizing from that instead.
    2. **Duplicate-library loading crash**: naively copying every `otool -L`
       dependency by its literal path/basename copied both a dylib's real
       versioned file (e.g. `libwx_osx_cocoau_core-3.3.3.0.0.dylib`) *and*
       its symlink aliases (`...-3.3.dylib`, `...-3.3.3.dylib`) as if they
       were different libraries, because different consumers reference the
       library under different symlink names. dyld then loaded the "same"
       library twice under two identities, which showed up as `objc[pid]:
       Class X is implemented in both ...` warnings, `wxIMPLEMENT_DYNAMIC_
       CLASS` RTTI-table-already-registered asserts, and eventually a fatal
       recursive assert inside `wxArtProvider::GetBitmap` while trying to
       show a log dialog (`SIGTRAP`, not the earlier `SIGSEGV` bugs — a new
       and different failure class, easy to mistake for one of those).
       Fixed by canonicalizing every resolved dependency path (following the
       symlink chain by hand, since macOS's `readlink` has no `-f`) before
       deciding whether it's "already bundled", so each real file is only
       ever copied and referenced once regardless of which name pointed to
       it.
  - Verified end-to-end: `make build` from a clean state produces a bundle
    that launches via both `open "build-macos/pgAdmin III.app"` and directly
    executing `Contents/MacOS/pgAdmin3`, with a real "pgAdmin III" Dock/menu-
    bar identity and no `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` set, no crash report, no
    duplicate-class warnings.
  - Windows isn't wired into `make` at all (existing build is
    vcxproj/MSVC-based, not shell/make-friendly) — the Makefile just prints
    a pointer to INSTALL.txt / the Visual Studio project for that case.
- 2026-07-13: Added `make release` (macOS only): `macos/publish_release.sh`
  plus two small helpers, `macos/changelog_notes.sh` (extracts one version's
  section body out of CHANGELOG.md — copied near-verbatim from the same
  script in `~/Code/pgarachne`, it's fully generic) and
  `macos/generate_homebrew_cask.sh`.
  - Modeled directly on `~/Code/pgarachne`'s release tooling rather than
    `~/Code/typolima`'s: typolima is a CLI tool distributed as a Homebrew
    **Formula** (installs into `bin/`), but pgAdmin3 (like pgarachne) is a
    GUI `.app`, which needs a Homebrew **Cask** instead — different DSL
    (`cask "pgadmin3" do ... app "pgAdmin III.app" ... end`), different tap
    subdirectory (`Casks/` not `Formula/`). Confirmed by inspecting
    `~/Code/homebrew-tap` (the actual tap repo both projects publish to)
    directly — it already has both a `Casks/` and `Formula/` directory in
    active use by other heptau projects.
  - Since this project doesn't track a real semver, releases are versioned
    by date: `date +%Y.%m.%d` (e.g. `2026.07.13`), tag `v2026.07.13`, with a
    `.2`/`.3`/... suffix appended if a same-day tag already exists locally
    or on the release remote (checked both places).
  - The release script **automatically promotes** CHANGELOG.md's
    `## [Unreleased]` section to `## [<version>]` (inserting a fresh empty
    Unreleased above it) and commits that as part of the release — this was
    a deliberate choice over pgarachne's flow, which requires the maintainer
    to hand-edit CHANGELOG.md before running `make release` and fails if the
    version's heading doesn't already exist. Given `make release` here is
    explicitly invoked to cut a release (not run automatically/on a timer),
    auto-promoting is safe and saves a manual step; every promotion is a
    normal, revertable git commit.
  - Only builds/publishes an **arm64** artifact (no Intel Mac support exists
    yet — the locally-built wxWidgets and this whole port have only ever
    targeted Apple Silicon). The cask has `depends_on arch: :arm64` and no
    `on_intel` block; add one (see `~/Code/pgarachne`'s cask for the pattern)
    if an amd64 build pipeline is ever set up.
  - Release script always pushes to `$RELEASE_REMOTE` (default `origin`,
    i.e. `heptau/pgadmin3`), never `upstream` (`levinsv/pgadmin3`) — matches
    the branching strategy at the top of this file.
  - Homebrew tap update reuses `heptau/homebrew-tap` (same tap typolima and
    pgarachne already publish to) via the GitHub API (`gh api .../contents/
    Casks/pgadmin3.rb`), no local tap clone needed.
  - Verified (without actually releasing — that's a real, public,
    hard-to-reverse action, left for the user to run deliberately): shell
    syntax of all three new scripts (`bash -n`), the Unreleased→versioned
    CHANGELOG promotion logic on a scratch copy of CHANGELOG.md, the
    changelog-notes extraction against the real CHANGELOG.md, and the
    generated cask file's Ruby syntax (`ruby -c`) against a dummy zip.
  - **Not yet exercised end-to-end**: the actual `gh release create` /
    Homebrew-tap-API-push steps, since that requires a real `gh auth login`
    session and would publish for real. First real `make release` run
    should be watched closely.
  - Real-world `make release` run surfaced three more issues, all fixed:
    (1) `gh release create` kept failing with a misleading "'workflow'
    scope may be required" error regardless of token scope, because
    `gh repo view`'s auto-detection picked `upstream` (no write access)
    instead of `origin` when both remotes are configured — fixed by always
    deriving the repo slug directly from `$RELEASE_REMOTE`'s URL, never via
    `gh`'s auto-detection. (2) The resume-detection (see above) only
    checked HEAD's commit message, which broke as soon as any other commit
    landed on top of the "Release vX.Y.Z" commit before a retry (e.g. a
    script bugfix) — fixed to check CHANGELOG.md's actual structure
    (`[Unreleased]` empty + a tag existing for the heading below it) instead,
    and to resume even if the GitHub release for that version already
    exists (only the remaining steps need to run then). (3) **The build
    isn't reproducible** (embedded timestamps / non-deterministic ad-hoc
    codesign output), so re-running `make release` after a release already
    exists and rebuilding would produce a *different* zip than what's
    already uploaded — the freshly-generated Homebrew cask's sha256 then
    didn't match the real downloadable asset, and `brew install` correctly
    rejected it. Fixed by checking whether the GitHub release exists
    *before* deciding to build at all: if it does, skip straight to pulling
    the real sha256 from the already-uploaded asset's `digest` field via
    the GitHub API instead of re-hashing a fresh local rebuild.
- 2026-07-13: User reported the main window's toolbar icons overlapping/too
  close together on macOS, with a request for tooltips. Tooltips were
  already wired up correctly (every `AddTool()` call already passes a
  `shortHelpString`, e.g. `_("Add a connection to a server.")` in
  `pgServer.cpp`'s `addServerFactory` — no code needed there). The overlap
  was real, though: `frmMain::CreateMenus()` (`frm/frmMain.cpp:376`) never
  calls `SetToolBitmapSize()` — the line is literally commented out
  (`git blame`: disabled by lsv on 2023-06-25, the same day as the SVG/HiDPI
  toolbar work per CHANGELOG.md — probably to fix a Windows-side sizing
  issue at the time) — while every menu factory that feeds tools into this
  toolbar (`addServerFactory`/`propertyFactory`/etc. in `pgServer.cpp`,
  `dlgProperty.cpp`, `plugins.cpp`, `frmMaintenance.cpp`,
  `frmEditGrid.cpp`'s view-data factories) requests its icon via
  `GetBundleSVG(..., wxSize(32, 32))`. Without `SetToolBitmapSize` telling
  it that size up front, `wxToolBar` auto-sizes tool cells from whatever it
  sees from the first tool, and on a Retina display the mismatch between
  that auto-derived (too-small) cell size and the actual 32x32-DIP icons
  being drawn produces visibly overlapping buttons. `frmQuery.cpp:612` and
  `frmStatus.cpp:423` already call
  `SetToolBitmapSize(FromDIP(wxSize(32, 32)))` — same pattern, just missing
  from frmMain. Fixed by adding that same call, gated to `#ifdef __WXMAC__`
  only (frm/frmMain.cpp) so as not to touch whatever behavior the maintainer
  was addressing on Windows/Linux in 2023. Verified visually: before/after
  screenshots of the toolbar (icons cleanly separated after the fix).
  Other `ctlMenuToolbar` users (`frmEditGrid`'s own toolbar, `frmConfig`,
  `frmDatabaseDesigner`, `debugger/frmDebugger`) use plain baked-in 16x16
  bitmaps (not `GetBundleSVG`/`wxBitmapBundle`) consistently matched to
  their own `SetToolBitmapSize(wxSize(16, 16))` calls, so they weren't
  affected by this specific bug (though they're not HiDPI/Retina-crisp
  either — a separate, lower-priority cosmetic gap, not reported by the
  user, left alone for now).

- 2026-07-14: User reported three light/dark-mode bugs on macOS: (1) some
  Object browser tree items had the wrong (black) background in light mode,
  (2) the SQL panel didn't repaint at all when switching the OS between
  light/dark while the app was running, (3) in dark mode some SQL panel text
  stayed black (unreadable on the dark background). Root-caused via a
  research subagent, then verified each fix directly by live-toggling macOS
  appearance (`osascript ... tell appearance preferences to set dark mode to
  true/false`) against an already-running instance — confirming both the
  live-refresh and the colour fixes actually work, not just compile.
  - **Root cause of (1)**: `pgServer::LoadServers()` (`schema/pgServer.cpp`
    ~line 1624, and the `pgServer` constructor's default `colour` parameter,
    `include/schema/pgServer.h:51`) used to snapshot the *current*
    `wxSYS_COLOUR_WINDOW` into the server's persisted `Colour` config value
    whenever no custom colour had been set, instead of leaving it empty.
    `ctlTree::AppendItem`/`SetItemImage` (`ctl/ctlTree.cpp`) only sets an
    explicit per-item background when `pgServer::GetColour()` is non-empty
    — so once that snapshot got written to config (baking in whatever the
    system looked like, light or dark, at that moment), every object under
    that server kept using the stale colour forever, regardless of later
    theme switches. Fixed by leaving `colour` empty in both places when the
    user hasn't explicitly picked one, letting the tree fall back to its own
    (correctly theme-aware) default background. This is a fix for *future*
    loads only — an already-corrupted `Colour=` value in an existing
    `~/Library/Preferences/pgadmin3 Preferences` file needs manual cleanup
    (see below); also removed a stray `wxLogError(wxT("ohoh"))` debug
    leftover in `ctl/ctlColourPicker.cpp`'s `UpdateColour()` that would have
    started firing constantly now that "no colour set" is the common case.
  - **Root cause of (2)**: zero bindings to `wxEVT_SYS_COLOUR_CHANGED`
    anywhere in the codebase — nothing ever re-applied colours on a live
    appearance switch. Fixed by extracting `ctlSQLBox::Create()`'s
    colour/style-setup block into a new `ApplyColourScheme()` method
    (`ctl/ctlSQLBox.cpp`/`include/ctl/ctlSQLBox.h`), called once from
    `Create()` and again from a new `OnSysColourChanged()` handler bound via
    `EVT_SYS_COLOUR_CHANGED` in the class's static event table.
  - **Root cause of (3)**: `ctlSQLBox`'s per-token SQL syntax colours
    (indices 1-11 of the style loop) come from `settings->GetSQLBoxColour(i)`
    (`include/utils/sysSettings.h`), whose *default* (when the user hasn't
    customized that index) was a single hardcoded light-mode palette —
    indices 10/11 literally `#000000`. Fixed by making
    `getDefaultElementColor()` branch on
    `wxSystemSettings::GetAppearance().IsUsingDarkBackground()` and return a
    second, lighter palette for dark backgrounds. Only affects indices the
    user has never explicitly customized (an existing `ctlSQLBox/ColourN`
    config entry is always respected as-is, in either mode).
  - **Found while testing, not a code bug**: this session's own dev/test
    config (`~/Library/Preferences/pgadmin3 Preferences`) had exactly the
    `Colour=#171717` snapshot described above baked into the `[Servers/1]`
    section (from earlier testing in a session where the system happened to
    be in dark mode) — deleted that one line by hand to confirm the object
    browser rendered correctly again; a real user hitting this would need
    the same one-line manual fix (or just re-set/clear the server's colour
    once via its Properties dialog, which now shows a blank swatch instead
    of a stale colour when none is set).
- 2026-07-14: Fixed localization catalogs never loading on macOS. Root
  cause: `pgAdmin3.cpp`'s `LocatePath()` sets `dataDir` from
  `wxStandardPaths::Get().GetDataDir()` on `__WXMAC__`, and per wx 3.3.3's
  Cocoa implementation (`src/osx/core/stdpaths.mm`) that resolves to
  `NSBundle.sharedSupportPath` (`Contents/SharedSupport`) — a distinct
  bundle directory from `GetResourcesDir()`'s `Contents/Resources`, and
  one `macos/build_app.sh` never created or populated. Fixed by adding a
  `SHAREDSUPPORT_DIR` to `macos/build_app.sh` and copying
  `x64/Release/i18n` (the only shipped-data macro dir among
  DOC_DIR/UI_DIR/I18N_DIR/BRANDING_DIR/PLUGINS_DIR that actually exists in
  the repo — prebuilt Windows release `.mo` catalogs, no source `.po`
  pipeline here) into `Contents/SharedSupport/i18n`; also copied
  `textcompare_report.template` there (used by the "Compare other
  objects" HTML report, whose Windows-hardcoded primary path fails on
  mac but whose `dataDir`-based fallback now works). Verified at runtime:
  rebuilt via `make build`, relaunched, confirmed via screenshot that the
  Object Browser now shows fully-translated strings ("Vlastnosti",
  "Popis", "Služba", status-bar messages like "Získávájí se podrobnosti o
  serveru... Dokončeno.") that only come from the gettext catalog, not
  hardcoded source literals — and no more silent fallback to English.
  Follow-up (not yet done): the shipped `cs_CZ` catalog is from 2014
  (upstream pgAdmin III) and is missing translations for strings added
  since; needs an audit/fill-in pass (tracked as a TODO below).
- 2026-07-14: Audited and filled in the Czech (cs_CZ) translation catalog.
  Extracted a fresh `.pot` via `xgettext` over all source files, merged it
  against the decompiled existing `cs_CZ.mo` (`msgunfmt` + `msgmerge
  --no-fuzzy-matching`) to find untranslated msgids: 544 total, of which
  138 were noise and correctly left untranslated —
  `dd/dditems/figures/xml/ddXmlStorage.cpp`'s internal DTD-building code
  (element/attribute name constants and literal DTD text, wrapped in `_()`
  by mistake upstream — translating these would corrupt the app's own ER
  diagram file format), `frm/mathplot.cpp` debug trace strings guarded by
  `#ifdef MATHPLOT_DO_LOGGING` (contain `ClassName::Method()` and are
  never user-facing), and a handful of SQL-fragment/format-placeholder-
  only concatenation glue (e.g. a bare `"_"`, `";\n"`, `"1.0"`). The
  remaining 406 genuine UI strings were translated into Czech (dispatched
  as 9 parallel batches of ~50 to keep terminology/style consistent via a
  shared glossary extracted from the existing catalog, e.g. Foreign
  Key -> cizí klíč, "Are you sure you wish to..." -> "Opravdu si
  přejete..."), then programmatically verified for zero mismatches in
  `%`-format-specifier count/order, `&` mnemonic-marker count, and
  `\t`-prefixed keyboard-accelerator suffixes before merging. Added
  `i18n/cs_CZ.po` to the repo as the new editable source of truth (there
  was none before — only the compiled `.mo` existed, checked in as a
  Windows release asset) and recompiled
  `x64/Release/i18n/cs_CZ/pgadmin3.mo` from it via `msgfmt`. Verified: the
  macOS bundle's copy of the `.mo` is byte-identical to the newly compiled
  one and contains the new strings correctly (checked via `msgunfmt`,
  e.g. `"New SQL &tab\tCtrl-T"` -> `"Nová &karta SQL\tCtrl-T"` with the
  accelerator suffix and mnemonic both intact).
- 2026-07-14: Same audit/fill-in pass repeated for Spanish (es_ES): 406
  genuine missing strings (identical set to Czech's, minus the noise —
  same source coverage baseline), translated into formal Spanish (Spain)
  using a glossary extracted from the existing catalog (Foreign Key ->
  Clave Ajena, "Are you sure..." -> "¿Está seguro de que desea...", etc).
  Added `i18n/es_ES.po`, recompiled `x64/Release/i18n/es_ES/pgadmin3.mo`,
  verified bundled `.mo` byte-identical and correct via `msgunfmt`.
- 2026-07-14: Same pass for German (de_DE) — 920 genuine missing strings,
  more than double the other languages (this catalog was noticeably less
  complete to begin with, e.g. missing much of the Database Designer/ER
  diagram tool and pgAgent job scheduler strings). Dispatched as 19
  parallel batches of ~50, cross-checking the existing shipped catalog
  for established compound-noun/gendered-article conventions (e.g. "Soll
  der/die/das X wirklich gelöscht werden?" varies article by object
  gender). Added `i18n/de_DE.po`, recompiled
  `x64/Release/i18n/de_DE/pgadmin3.mo`, verified bundled `.mo`.
- 2026-07-14: Same pass for French (fr_FR) — 406 genuine missing strings
  (same baseline as es/cs), translated into formal French with the
  existing catalog's guillemet-quote convention (« ... »). Added
  `i18n/fr_FR.po`, recompiled `x64/Release/i18n/fr_FR/pgadmin3.mo`,
  verified bundled `.mo`. This completes all 4 languages requested this
  session (cs_CZ, es_ES, de_DE, fr_FR) — 2138 strings translated total
  across the four catalogs.
- 2026-07-21: Completed all remaining languages — all 45 shipped `.mo`
  catalogs were recovered as editable `.po` sources, merged against the
  current POT, and missing translations filled in (Google Translate for
  bulk, human translation for cs/es/de/fr). Every language builds with 0
  untranslated entries and passes `msgfmt -c`. 11 languages that had broken
  headers or format-specifier mismatches (zh_CN, de_DE, ja_JP, fa_IR, ko_KR,
  pl_PL, zh_TW, af_ZA, sr_RS, lv_LV, ru_RU) were also repaired in the
  process.

## Known TODOs / not yet solved

- tests/ (Catch2) disabled on macOS in CMakeLists.txt — needs either a
  Catch2 v2 compat shim or porting tests/test_Formatter.cpp to Catch2 v3
  (`catch2/catch_test_macros.hpp` etc).
- App icon is upscaled from a single 256x256 source (`include/images/
  pgAdmin3.ico`) — looks fine at normal Dock size but real multi-resolution
  artwork would look sharper at 512/1024.
- Not code-signed with a real Developer ID (ad-hoc only) or notarized —
  fine for running on this machine, but Gatekeeper will complain
  ("unidentified developer") if the `.app` is copied to another Mac; the
  user would need to right-click → Open the first time there.
- Debug-symbol splitting (dsymutil/strip) skipped on macOS, unlike Windows'
  objcopy-based split — cosmetic, not blocking.

<!-- Append new dated entries below as work progresses. -->

- 2026-08-27: Rebased a separate line of work onto this fork. That work had
  been done independently on top of `levinsv/pgadmin3` (a Windows-first branch
  plus a from-scratch macOS bundle attempt) before discovering this fork
  already had the macOS port. Everything bundle-related from that attempt was
  thrown away in favour of `macos/build_app.sh`; only the genuinely
  independent pieces were carried over. Notes worth keeping:
  - **`GetDataDir()` → `SharedSupport` is not wx-3.3-specific.** The
    2026-07-14 entry above attributes it to wx 3.3.3's `stdpaths.mm`. Measured
    it directly under **wx 3.2.11** (a shared `--with-osx_cocoa` build at
    `~/opt/wx32`), both as a bare binary and inside a real `.app`:
    `GetDataDir()` returns `Contents/SharedSupport` and `GetResourcesDir()`
    returns `Contents/Resources` in both. So `build_app.sh`'s choice of
    `SHAREDSUPPORT_DIR` is correct across both wx versions, and the
    Resources-vs-SharedSupport trap will catch anyone who reasons about it
    from the CMake `MACOSX_BUNDLE` side (where `Resources` is the obvious
    destination) instead of measuring.
  - **`settings.ini` was missing from the bundle.** `LocatePath(SETTINGS_INI,
    true)` searches the same `dataDir` as `i18n`, so it belongs in
    `SharedSupport` too — `build_app.sh` now copies it. Found by raising
    `LogLevel` to 4 and reading the path dump at `pgAdmin3.cpp:467-472`; the
    "Settings INI" line was empty. That path dump is the fastest way to check
    any resource-location change, but note it only reaches the log at
    `LogLevel == 4` (`LOG_DEBUG`) and there is no command-line flag for it —
    the value has to be edited in `~/Library/Preferences/pgadmin3 Preferences`
    while the app is **not** running, since wxFileConfig flushes over the file
    on exit.
  - **Building against wx 3.2.11 instead of `~/wx-cocoa-classic` works
    unchanged.** `WX_COCOA_PREFIX=$HOME/opt/wx32
    POSTGRESQL_PREFIX=/opt/homebrew/opt/libpq make build` produces a working,
    self-contained `.app` (`otool -L` on the inner binary shows zero refs
    outside the bundle). No source changes were needed for the older wx, and
    the `wx/dynarray.h` patch the 2026-07-13 entry describes is not needed on
    3.2.x — that bug is specific to wx 3.3's `wxVector`-backed `wxBaseArray`.
    Useful as a fallback if a wx 3.3.x point release regresses.
  - **Dark mode: the editor background was the missing half.**
    `GetSQLColour()` already returned a dark lexer palette, but the five
    editor colour getters (`ColourBackground`, `ColourForeground`,
    `ColourCaret`, `CaretColourBackground`, `MarginBackgroundColour`) were
    still unconditional light literals, so the dark palette was being drawn
    onto a white editor. Added `sysSettings::IsDarkAppearance()` as one shared
    accessor and pointed the existing inline
    `wxSystemSettings::GetAppearance().IsUsingDarkBackground()` call at it too.
    Caveat unchanged from before: the palette is read when the widget is
    constructed, so the colour *defaults* still need an app restart after an
    appearance switch even though the repaint fix from 2026-07-14 handles the
    redraw.
