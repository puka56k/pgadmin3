# =============================================================================
# publish_release.sh — build, zip, tag, and publish a pgAdmin3 macOS release
# to GitHub, plus update the Homebrew tap.
#
# Run via `make release`. This project doesn't track a real semantic
# version, so releases are versioned by date (YYYY.MM.DD), with a numeric
# suffix (.2, .3, ...) if more than one release happens on the same day.
#
# What it does, in order:
#   1. Refuses to run with a dirty working tree or without `gh` installed.
#   2. Computes today's date-based version (with collision-avoidance), or
#      resumes a previous attempt's version if one is pending (see the
#      "Resume detection" comment below).
#   3. Promotes the CHANGELOG.md "## [Unreleased]" section to
#      "## [<version>]" (leaving a fresh empty Unreleased above it) and
#      commits that change. Skipped when resuming.
#   4. Tags v<version>, pushes the tag + the changelog commit to `origin`
#      (never `upstream` -- see AGENTS.md's branching strategy: this repo
#      pulls from upstream but only ever pushes to the user's own fork).
#   5. Packages a portable Windows zip (windows/package_release.sh) from the
#      committed x64/Release/ build -- no Windows/compiler involved, just
#      bundling in guru hints and supplementary wxstd.mo catalogs it's
#      missing. Always rebuilt (cheap, fully reproducible from committed
#      sources); only the upload is skipped if already attached to an
#      existing release.
#   6. If a GitHub release for this tag already exists, skip straight to
#      reusing its already-uploaded macOS zip's checksum (see "GitHub
#      release" comment below for why). Otherwise: build the app (`make
#      build`), re-stamp Info.plist with the release version, zip it,
#      compute its checksum, and create the GitHub release with the
#      extracted changelog notes and both zips/checksums as assets.
#   7. Generates and pushes an updated Homebrew Cask to the heptau/homebrew-tap
#      repo, via the GitHub API (no local clone needed).
#
# Environment variables:
#   HOMEBREW_TAP_REPO   GitHub repo of the Homebrew tap (default:
#                        heptau/homebrew-tap -- "brew install
#                        heptau/tap/pgadmin3" expands to this repo name per
#                        Homebrew's tap-naming convention).
#   RELEASE_REMOTE       Git remote to push the tag/commit to and to read
#                        the GitHub repo slug from (default: origin).

CHANGELOG="CHANGELOG.md"

# ── Resume detection ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# If CHANGELOG.md's [Unreleased] section is already empty, a previous run
# already promoted it to some [<version>] section (e.g. it tagged + pushed
# that commit but then failed on a later step -- gh auth, wrong --repo, a
# network blip, whatever). Reuse that exact version -- identified as the
# heading right after [Unreleased] -- instead of computing a fresh one.
# There being nothing new under [Unreleased] to promote is precisely the
# signal that we're continuing a previous attempt, not starting a new
# release; every step below (tag, release, Homebrew tap) already has its own
# idempotency check, so it's fine to resume even if some of those steps (e.g.
# the GitHub release itself) already succeeded in a prior run -- they'll just
# be skipped and whatever's left (e.g. only the Homebrew tap push) will run.
#
# NB: this deliberately does NOT look at HEAD's commit message (an earlier
# version of this check did, and broke the moment any other commit -- e.g. a
# script bugfix -- landed on top of the "Release vX.Y.Z" commit before the
# retry). Looking at CHANGELOG.md's actual structure instead is robust to
# that.
